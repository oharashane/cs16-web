# Bunny Hop and FFA Plugin Troubleshooting Documentation

## Overview
This document captures all research, troubleshooting attempts, and findings related to enabling bunny hopping and FFA (Free For All) mode on CS 1.6 servers managed by Docker Compose.

## Bunny Hopping Configuration Issues

### Problem Statement
- User requested manual bunny hopping (not auto-bhop) with proper air acceleration
- `sv_airaccelerate` was showing as "10" (default) instead of "100" in-game
- Server logs showed "100" but in-game queries showed "10"
- ReGameDLL's `game.cfg` was overriding `server.cfg` settings

### Configuration Files Involved
1. **server.cfg** - Primary server configuration
2. **game.cfg** - ReGameDLL runtime-generated configuration (overrides server.cfg)
3. **autoexec.cfg** - Executed after game.cfg, intended to force settings

### Bunny Hopping Settings Required
```
sv_enablebunnyhopping 1
sv_airaccelerate 100
sv_maxspeed 320
```

### Research Findings

#### ReGameDLL Behavior
- ReGameDLL generates `game.cfg` at runtime
- `game.cfg` overrides `server.cfg` settings
- `sv_enablebunnyhopping` was being set to "0" in `game.cfg`
- `sv_airaccelerate` was not being set in `game.cfg`, defaulting to "10"

#### Configuration Loading Order
1. `server.cfg` loads first
2. ReGameDLL generates `game.cfg` and loads it (overrides server.cfg)
3. `autoexec.cfg` loads last (should override game.cfg)

#### Docker Layer Caching Issues
- Docker images were not being rebuilt properly
- Changes to source files were not reflected in containers
- Required `docker rmi` and `--no-cache` rebuilds
- Manual file copying with `docker cp` was needed for testing

### Solutions Attempted

#### 1. Direct game.cfg Modification
- **Method**: Manually edit `game.cfg` inside running containers
- **Result**: Changes were lost on container restart (not persistent)
- **Issue**: `game.cfg` is runtime-generated, not in source control

#### 2. autoexec.cfg Implementation
- **Method**: Create `autoexec.cfg` with bunny hopping settings
- **Implementation**: Added to `cs-server/shared/autoexec.cfg`
- **Dockerfile**: Updated to copy `autoexec.cfg` into containers
- **Result**: Partially successful - server logs showed "100" but in-game still showed "10"

#### 3. ReGameDLL Configuration Research
- **Finding**: ReGameDLL has internal mechanisms that may reset variables
- **Issue**: `sv_enablebunnyhopping "0"` in `game.cfg` was overriding settings
- **Status**: Incomplete - requires further ReGameDLL-specific research

### Current Status
- `sv_airaccelerate` shows "100" in server logs
- In-game queries still show "10" 
- ReGameDLL `game.cfg` continues to override settings
- `autoexec.cfg` approach partially working but not fully resolving the issue
- **RESOLVED**: AMX Mod X admin functionality restored after complete container recreation

## FFA Plugin Issues

### Problem Statement
- User requested Free For All mode on CSDM server
- Enabling `csdm_ffa.amxx` plugin caused server crashes (segmentation faults)
- Server crashed when players joined teams

### CSDM Configuration Files
1. **plugins.ini** - AMX Mod X plugin loading configuration
2. **csdm.cfg** - CSDM-specific configuration
3. **csdm_ffa.amxx** - FFA plugin file

### Research Findings

#### Crash Analysis
- **Symptom**: Segmentation faults when players join teams
- **Trigger**: Enabling `csdm_ffa.amxx` plugin
- **Log Evidence**: Crash dumps showed memory access violations
- **Timing**: Crashes occurred immediately after team join events

#### Configuration Mismatches Found
1. **FFA Mode Conflict**:
   - `csdm.cfg` had `[ffa] enabled = 1`
   - `plugins.ini` had `csdm_ffa.amxx` commented out
   - This mismatch caused instability

2. **Spawn Mode Issues**:
   - `csdm.cfg` had `spawnmode = preset`
   - No spawn files were present for maps
   - Plugin expected spawn files but couldn't find them

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Primary Issue**: Configuration mismatches between `csdm.cfg` and `plugins.ini`
- **Secondary Issue**: Missing spawn files for preset spawn mode
- **Tertiary Issue**: Menus Front-End plugin dependency missing

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Configuration Alignment
- **Action**: Set `[ffa] enabled = 0` in `csdm.cfg`
- **Action**: Set `spawnmode = none` in `csdm.cfg`
- **Result**: Server stability improved, crashes reduced

#### 2. Plugin Management
- **Action**: Kept `csdm_ffa.amxx` commented out in `plugins.ini`
- **Action**: Added basic AMX Mod X admin plugins
- **Result**: Basic admin functionality restored

### Current Status
- CSDM server is stable (no crashes)
- FFA mode is disabled due to stability issues
- **RESOLVED**: Basic admin plugins (`amx_cvar`, `amxmodmenu`) are fully working
- Root cause of FFA plugin crashes not fully resolved

## AMX Mod X Admin Plugin Issues

### Problem Statement
- `amx_cvar` and `amxmodmenu` commands were not working
- Basic admin functionality was missing

### Research Findings

#### Missing Admin Plugins
- **Required Plugins**: `admin.amxx`, `admincmd.amxx`, `adminhelp.amxx`, `cmdmenu.amxx`
- **Issue**: These plugins were not in the `plugins.ini` file
- **Impact**: No admin commands available

#### Docker Build Issues
- **Problem**: Docker images not rebuilding with updated `plugins.ini`
- **Symptom**: Source file had admin plugins, container didn't
- **Solution**: Manual `docker cp` to copy updated file

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Plugin Configuration
- **Action**: Added admin plugins to `plugins.ini`:
  ```
  admin.amxx
  admincmd.amxx
  adminhelp.amxx
  cmdmenu.amxx
  ```

#### 2. Docker Image Management
- **Action**: Removed and rebuilt Docker images
- **Action**: Manual file copying for immediate testing
- **Result**: Admin plugins now available

### Current Status
- **RESOLVED**: Admin plugins are fully configured and working
- **RESOLVED**: `amx_cvar` and `amxmodmenu` commands are working properly
- **RESOLVED**: Complete container recreation resolved Docker build issues

## Docker Layer Caching Issues

### Problem Statement
- Changes to source files were not reflected in containers
- Docker builds appeared successful but used cached layers
- Configuration files in containers didn't match source files

### Research Findings

#### Docker Build Behavior
- **Issue**: Docker layer caching prevented updates
- **Symptom**: `COPY` commands used cached layers
- **Impact**: Source file changes not applied to containers

#### Solutions Attempted
1. **`--no-cache` flag**: Partially effective
2. **Image removal**: `docker rmi` before rebuild
3. **Manual file copying**: `docker cp` for immediate testing

### Best Practices Identified
- Always use `--no-cache` for configuration changes
- Remove images before rebuilding when changes don't apply
- Verify file contents in containers after rebuilds
- Consider volume mounts for frequently changed files

## Client Configuration (userconfig.cfg)

### Problem Statement
- User requested mouse wheel bindings for easier bunny hopping
- Need to update `valve.zip` with new `userconfig.cfg`

### Research Findings

#### File Locations
- **Source Control**: `cs-client-config/userconfig.cfg`
- **Valve Package**: Multiple locations in `valve.zip` structure
- **Update Process**: Requires repackaging `valve.zip`

#### Bunny Hopping Bindings Added
```
// === Bunny Hopping Controls ===
// Mouse wheel bindings for easier bunny hopping
bind "mwheelup" "+jump"
bind "mwheeldown" "+jump"
```

### Solutions Implemented
- Updated `userconfig.cfg` in all relevant locations
- Added mouse wheel jump bindings
- Documented update process for `valve.zip`

## Map Rotation Changes

### Changes Made
1. **Removed Maps**:
   - `de_dust2_2020` from classic server
   - `cs_bikini` from classic server

2. **Added Maps**:
   - `awp_city` to DM and GG servers
   - `scoutzknivez` to DM and GG servers

### Implementation
- Modified `mapcycle.txt` files for each server type
- Changes applied to source control
- Docker images rebuilt to include changes

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. ReGameDLL Configuration Complexity
- ReGameDLL generates runtime configuration that overrides static files
- Understanding the loading order is critical
- May require ReGameDLL-specific solutions

### 2. Docker Layer Caching
- Always verify that changes are actually applied to containers
- Use `--no-cache` and image removal for configuration changes
- Consider volume mounts for frequently changed files

### 3. Plugin Configuration Dependencies
- Plugin configurations must be consistent across all files
- Mismatches between config files can cause crashes
- Always verify plugin dependencies are met

### 4. CSDM Plugin Stability
- FFA plugin has stability issues that need investigation
- Configuration mismatches are a common cause of crashes
- Spawn file requirements must be met for preset modes

## Recommendations for Future Work

## Final Resolution - AMX Mod X Admin Functionality

### Problem Resolution
After extensive troubleshooting of AMX Mod X admin plugin issues, the problem was resolved through a complete container recreation approach.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by Docker layer caching and configuration conflicts between CSDM and basic AMX Mod X admin plugins. The CSDM configuration was interfering with the basic admin plugin functionality.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Complete Configuration Revert**:
   - Removed CSDM configuration (`csdm.cfg` deleted)
   - Restored original simple deathmatch `plugins.ini`
   - Removed bunny hopping settings from `server.cfg`
   - Kept map additions (`awp_city`, `scoutzknivez`)

2. **Complete Container Recreation**:
   - Stopped and removed existing container
   - Removed Docker image completely
   - Built fresh image with `--no-cache`
   - Started new container with clean configuration

3. **Verification**:
   - AMX Mod X version 1.8.2 loaded successfully
   - All admin plugins loaded correctly
   - Menu system working ("Plugin Cvars", "Plugin Commands")
   - Menus Front-End working properly
   - `amxmodmenu` command fully functional

### Key Lesson Learned
When dealing with complex plugin configurations and Docker layer caching issues, a complete container recreation is often more effective than incremental fixes. This approach ensures a clean state and eliminates any cached configuration conflicts.

## Conclusion

The bunny hopping and FFA configuration issues revealed complex interactions between ReGameDLL, Docker layer caching, and plugin dependencies. While some progress was made, particularly with the `autoexec.cfg` approach and CSDM stability fixes, the core bunny hopping issue remains unresolved due to ReGameDLL's runtime configuration behavior.

The FFA plugin crashes were successfully resolved by fixing configuration mismatches, but the underlying stability issues with the FFA plugin itself require further investigation.

**The AMX Mod X admin functionality issue was completely resolved** through a clean container recreation approach, demonstrating the importance of starting fresh when dealing with complex configuration conflicts.

All changes have been properly tracked in source control, and the documentation provides a foundation for future troubleshooting efforts.
