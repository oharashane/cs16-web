Heck yes—this is exactly the kind of capture I hoped you’d get. Your plan is solid; here’s a quick “engineering review” + a few traps to avoid before you flip the big switch.
Green lights on your plan

    Your captured signaling wrapper ({event, data} with offer/answer/candidate) and no greeting is correct. Your relay should treat the first WS frame as an offer, then mirror that wrapper back for answer/candidate.

    Multiple renegotiation rounds are normal; just make sure your server handles a new offer at any time (replace the current remote description and create a fresh answer).

What to tighten up (high-impact)

    DataChannel reliability mode
    GoldSrc expects UDP-ish behavior. Create the channel with unordered, unreliable semantics:

// in the client’s net layer (if you have access)
// or ensure the engine uses these under the hood
pc.createDataChannel("gamedata", { ordered: false, maxRetransmits: 0 });

If you can’t change the client, you’re probably fine (it’ll be reliable by default), but reliable + ordered can add head-of-line blocking under loss. If you see rubber-banding under packet loss, this is the knob to revisit (you can also set it server-side when you create the channel, if that’s your side).

    Audio m-line: reject it on the answer
    Your offer includes an m=audio (the engine opens a mic), but you’re not bridging RTP to ReHLDS. In your answer, keep audio a=inactive (or reject the m-line) so the browser doesn’t try to stream audio. That’s exactly what your captured good flow did—mirror that.

    Binary framing, not text
    Set dataChannel.binaryType = 'arraybuffer' and treat every inbound message as one UDP datagram. Do not re-chunk or coalesce; preserve message boundaries 1:1 → perfect match for UDP.

    One UDP socket per browser client
    GoldSrc distinguishes clients by (source IP, source port). When each WebRTC session goes live, socket = new UDP() bound to an ephemeral local port. Forward only that session’s messages over this socket to rehlds:27015. Keep a tiny session map:

pc_id -> { dchan, udp_sock, server_addr, last_seen }

This lets many web clients share a single relay host/IP cleanly.

    Backpressure & flood control

    Watch dataChannel.bufferedAmount; if it spikes (e.g., > 256 KiB), pause UDP reads temporarily so you don’t drown the browser.

    Consider basic rate-limits on control-less connectionless packets so ReHLDS doesn’t ban your relay for “flooding” when multiple players connect at once.

Bridging skeleton (aiortc side)

Pseudocode for the relay loop (trim to taste):

# on WS 'offer' (wrapped) -> setRemote, createAnswer, send wrapped 'answer'
pc = RTCPeerConnection()
chan = None

@pc.on("datachannel")
def on_dc(dc):
    nonlocal chan
    chan = dc
    udp = socket.socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
    udp.bind(("0.0.0.0", 0))  # unique ephemeral port per session
    server = ("127.0.0.1", 27015)

    # DC -> UDP
    @dc.on("message")
    def on_msg(msg):
        if isinstance(msg, (bytes, bytearray, memoryview)):
            udp.sendto(msg, server)

    # UDP -> DC
    udp.setblocking(False)
    async def pump_udp():
        loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
        while True:
            data, _ = await loop.sock_recvfrom(udp, 2048)
            if dc.readyState != "open": break
            if dc.bufferedAmount < 262144:  # simple backpressure
                dc.send(data)
            else:
                await asyncio.sleep(0.002)
    asyncio.create_task(pump_udp())

Notes:

    Do not reinterpret the payload—just forward bytes.

    2048 recv buffer is fine; GoldSrc packets are small (< 1500). If you ever see larger, bump it.

    Keep a timeout/heartbeat to clean up dead sessions.

Smoke tests before “full gameplay”

A. A2S_INFO probe (connectionless):
From the browser client, you should see the relay send 0xFFFFFFFF 'T' 'Source Engine Query\0' to the server and get a reply. Log the first 8–12 bytes in both directions to confirm parity with a native client capture.

B. Connect handshake:
Watch the server console for a new client slot after the challenge/auth exchange. If it stalls at challenge, make sure you’re not dropping any message boundaries on the DataChannel.

C. Two clients at once:
Confirm separate UDP sockets get created, and the server handles both (no slot collisions). If ReHLDS has per-IP limits enabled, you may need to tweak those since all players arrive from the relay’s IP.
Renegotiation & ICE gotchas

    Your capture showed multiple offer/answer rounds. Implement a simple “latest wins” path: when a new offer arrives, pc.setRemoteDescription(offer) → pc.setLocalDescription(await pc.createAnswer()) and send the new wrapped answer.

    Accept trickle ICE in both directions (event: "candidate"). aiortc is fine here. If you later deploy on the open internet, add a TURN server for the browser side; your relay will have server-grade egress anyway.

Debug checklist (fast)

    WS frames match your wrapper exactly (event, data, casing).

    Answer rejects audio (or sets inactive) to avoid audio plumbing.

    DataChannel opens and reports binaryType==="arraybuffer".

    For each session: new UDP socket, and bytes flow both ways.

    ReHLDS shows the client attempting to connect (and ideally joining).

If gameplay feels “sticky”

    Try unordered+unreliable channel (see #1).

    Cap dataChannel.bufferedAmount and drop late server → client updates (they’ll be “old state” anyway).

    If one player lag spikes all others: you likely still have ordered+reliable head-of-line; revisit channel options.

What not to worry about (yet)

    Max message size: your SDP showed a=max-message-size in the answer (~256 KiB). CS1.6 packets are tiny, so you won’t hit it.

    Voice: leave it disabled until gameplay is stable; ReHLDS voice rides the game UDP port, but mapping browser Opus↔GoldSrc voice is a separate project.
