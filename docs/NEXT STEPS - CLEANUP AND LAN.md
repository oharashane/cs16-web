# Next Steps: Cleanup and LAN Research

## üßπ Repository Cleanup TODOs

### High Priority
- [ ] **Remove orphaned containers/images** - Clean up unused Docker artifacts from experiments
- [ ] **Consolidate documentation** - Merge/organize overlapping PLAN C documents  
- [ ] **Remove redundant files** - Clean up duplicate configs and test files
- [ ] **Update README.md** - Make it the single source of truth for setup

### Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Review .gitignore** - Ensure proper exclusions (logs, temp files, etc.)
- [ ] **Clean up docker-compose files** - Remove unused environment variables
- [ ] **Organize client assets** - Verify which files are actually needed
- [ ] **Document dependencies** - List all required packages/tools clearly

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Add linting/formatting** - Consistent code style across files
- [ ] **Create automated tests** - Verify setup works end-to-end
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Review resource usage and limits
- [ ] **Security review** - Check for hardcoded secrets, open ports, etc.

## üåê LAN Deployment Research

### Current State Analysis
**Current Setup:** Everything runs on `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- CS Server: `127.0.0.1:27015`
- Web Server: `127.0.0.1:8080` 
- All services use `network_mode: "host"`

### LAN Requirements to Research

#### 1. Network Architecture Design
- [ ] **Multi-host networking** - How to expose services across LAN
- [ ] **Service discovery** - How clients find the game server
- [ ] **Load balancing** - Multiple game servers support
- [ ] **Firewall considerations** - Required port openings

#### 2. WebRTC LAN Challenges  
- [ ] **STUN/TURN servers** - Do we need them for LAN?
- [ ] **ICE candidate filtering** - Prefer local network candidates
- [ ] **NAT traversal** - Probably not needed for LAN but verify
- [ ] **mDNS/Bonjour** - Auto-discovery on local network

#### 3. Configuration Changes Needed
- [ ] **Dynamic IP discovery** - Replace hardcoded `127.0.0.1`
- [ ] **Environment variables** - Configurable host/port settings
- [ ] **Docker networking** - Bridge vs host mode for LAN
- [ ] **Reverse proxy** - Nginx/Caddy for proper routing

#### 4. Client Modifications
- [ ] **Server list API** - Dynamic server discovery
- [ ] **Connection UI** - Server browser interface  
- [ ] **Auto-connect logic** - Smart server selection
- [ ] **Error handling** - Better network failure messages

#### 5. Deployment Models to Consider

##### Option A: Single Host (Current + LAN exposure)
```
[Host Machine]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CS Server (exposed to LAN)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebRTC Server (exposed to LAN) 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ All clients connect to this host
```

##### Option B: Distributed (Multiple hosts)
```
[Game Host] ‚îÄ‚îÄ CS Server
[Web Host]  ‚îÄ‚îÄ WebRTC Server + Client files
[Client N]  ‚îÄ‚îÄ Browser connections
```

##### Option C: Docker Swarm/Kubernetes
```
[Orchestrated Cluster]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Load Balancer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game Server Pods
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebRTC Server Pods
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Shared Storage
```

### Research Questions

#### Technical Questions
- [ ] How does WebRTC behave in LAN-only environments?
- [ ] Do we need a TURN server for LAN, or is STUN sufficient?
- [ ] What's the best way to handle dynamic IP assignment?
- [ ] How do we handle multiple concurrent games?

#### Configuration Questions  
- [ ] What Docker networking mode works best for LAN?
- [ ] How to make environment variables dynamic?
- [ ] Should we use DNS names vs IP addresses?
- [ ] How to handle different subnet configurations?

#### User Experience Questions
- [ ] How should players discover available servers?
- [ ] What happens when a game server goes down?
- [ ] How to handle player reconnection?
- [ ] Should we support persistent player profiles?

### Validation Plan
1. **Local testing** - Test with VMs on same host
2. **LAN testing** - Test across multiple physical machines  
3. **Performance testing** - Measure latency/throughput
4. **Failure testing** - Network interruptions, server crashes
5. **User testing** - Real gameplay scenarios

## üîç Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Research (No Changes)
- Study WebRTC LAN behavior
- Review Docker networking options
- Research similar projects/solutions
- Document findings and trade-offs

### Phase 2: Design
- Create network architecture diagrams
- Define configuration variables needed
- Plan migration strategy from localhost
- Design testing approach

### Phase 3: Implementation (Future)
- Make minimal changes for LAN support
- Maintain backward compatibility with localhost
- Test thoroughly before deployment
- Document new setup procedures
